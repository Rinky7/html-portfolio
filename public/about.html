<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a Senior .Net Developer with over a decade of experience, I specialize in the comprehensive design, 
  development, analysis, testing, implementation, and maintenance of a wide array of applications, 
  spanning client/server, internet/intranet, Windows, and web-based systems utilizing n-tier architecture. 
  My expertise encompasses a robust knowledge of .Net components, including C#, ASP.Net, VB.NET, PL/SQL, 
  ASP.Net MVC, ADO.Net, and the ADO.Net Entity Framework, underpinned by a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science
  and Engineering from CBIT in 2013.</p>

<p>I have demonstrated proficiency in deploying, operating, and maintaining systems within the Microsoft Azure 
  environment, leveraging my adeptness in cloud technologies, mobile development, and responsive design for both
  Android and iOS platforms. My technical acumen extends to front-end development with a command over HTML5/CSS3,
  and JavaScript frameworks such as Angular, React, and Node.js, ensuring that I deliver cutting-edge solutions
  that are both efficient and scalable.</p>

<p>Throughout my career, I've engaged in the entire System Development Life Cycle (SDLC), showcasing my ability
  to not only adapt to fast-paced environments but also to excel in them by providing innovative solutions and 
  enhancements. My role at Workday, the State of CA, West Monroe Partners, Northfield Bank, and 3i InfoTech, 
  have all been marked by significant contributions, ranging from developing single-page applications, 
  implementing Azure solutions, to optimizing database operations across SQL Server, PostgreSQL, 
  and NoSQL databases like MongoDB.</p>
